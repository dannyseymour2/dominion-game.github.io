# Ground Rules

## Regular Check-ins
[Running ToDo Lists](/todos)
Check in with this each day (Slackbot reminder perhaps?)

## Communication
Slack primarily on our subchannel, and also face to face checkins during class days. Weekend meetups when deliverables approach (online or in person).

## Other goals:
Commuinication is key! All of us have work and professional experience, so we all know how to critique, request changes, or bring up concerns in a respectful way.

## Weekly Meetings:
When necessary.

## Daily Scrums:
Weeks before deliverables

## E-Sign:
Sign your name here and push changes
