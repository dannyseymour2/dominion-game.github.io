# Build instructions:

* Navigate to https://github.com/dominion-game

### To open the dominion-android-client: 
* Click on the dominion-android repository
* Click on the green "Clone or download button" and copy the SSH key. 
* Clone the dominion-android project to your machine using IntelliJ's Check out from Version Control/Git
command (in the welcome screen), or the New/Project from Version Control/Git command (in the
workspace). This is an Android project, so please do not open it immediately after cloning!
* Instead, import the project. If you are already in a project select File/New/Project from Existing
Sources. From IntelliJ's welcome screen, select Import project from existing sources and find the
project directory you just cloned. On the next window, select Gradle as the "External Model".
* After the project is imported add a run configuration. This should use the Android App
configuration, with a Name of "app", and with app selected from the Module pull-down control.
* Lastly, run the app by clicking the run button (green play button).

### To open the dominion-server:
* Click on the dominion-service repository
* Click on the green "Clone or download button" and copy the SSH key. 
* Clone the dominion-service project to your machine using IntelliJ's Check out from Version Control/Git

* Instead, import the project. If you are already in a project select File/New/Project from Existing
Sources. From IntelliJ's welcome screen, select Import project from existing sources and find the
project directory you just cloned. On the next window, select Maven as the "External Model".
