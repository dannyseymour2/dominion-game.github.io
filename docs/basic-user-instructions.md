###Welcome to Dominion!

Once you've launched the app, you will be asked to sign in with your google account.

Following sign in, you will see a screen with both a "Start New Game" and "Game Instructions" button
on it. If you would like to read the instructions before beginning please feel free to do so my tapping
on the "Game Instructions" button. Otherwise, tap the "Start New Game" button to start a new game. 

In order to play, you will be matched with an opponent. There may be a waiting phase while this occurs.

Once a match has been found, the game will initialize: your "actions" and "buys" will be set to 1 and 
you will be given your hand of cards. You may swipe right or left to view all of the cards in your hand.
When it is your turn, you will begin in the "action" phase. This allows you to play action cards until
you are out of actions. When you have finished the action phase (or choose to leave it) the game will
transition you to the buy phase. The buy phase allows you to buy cards from the game's stacks to add
to your draw pile. The stacks include special action cards or cards that increase your gold or victory
points. You may continue to buy until you run out of buys or gold. When you finish the buy phase you
will see a summary of all of the plays you made that turn. This is also displayed to your opponent,
who will then be able to start their turn. You will be notified when it is your turn to play again. 

The game continues until all of the Province cards have been purchased or until any 3 stacks have been
depleted. The player with the most Victory points at the end of the game is the WINNER!  

At any point you may also choose to sign out of the app. Do this by accessing the options menu and 
clicking sign out.

Enjoy!
