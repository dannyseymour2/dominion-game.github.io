#Game Rules

Dominion is a deck-building card game. Each player uses a separate deck of cards and
draw their hands from their own decks, not others'. Players use the cards in their
hands to either perform actions or buy select cards from a common pool of card stacks.
The player with the most victory points at the end wins. This fast paced game is meant to be played 
with friends whenever and where ever you'd like to play it.
